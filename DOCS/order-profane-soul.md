# Order of the Profane Soul

**Source:** [DND Beyond - Blood Hunter Orders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#BloodHunterOrder-1610847)

Blood hunters belonging to the Order of the Profane Soul have pushed the limits of hemocraft for use against some of the most terrifying creatures corrupting the world. Ancient fiends and cruel magic-users have long counted on their ability to meld into the background and escape those who hunt them, vanishing into noble courts without a trace, or bending the minds of the most stalwart warriors with but a glance. So the blood hunters who founded this order trusted to their resilience as they delved into the same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater threats. And though they might have traded a part of themselves for their power, the members of this order know the benefits of that power far outweigh the price.

- Gain Eldritch Invocations

**Fighter (3 levels)**
- Action Surge for burst rounds
- Battle Master maneuvers
- Champion for crit fishing

**Avoid:**
- Classes that use different mental stats (Wizard if you use Wisdom, Cleric if you use Intelligence)
