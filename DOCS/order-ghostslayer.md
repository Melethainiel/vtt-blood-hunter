# Order of the Ghostslayer

**Source:** [DND Beyond - Blood Hunter Orders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#BloodHunterOrder-1610847)

The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest of the blood hunter orders, its members having originally rediscovered the secrets of hemocraft and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the mystery of the transition from life, and the unholy power that can cause the dead to rise once more. These zealous blood hunters make it their life's work to destroy the scourge of undeath wherever it is found, tuning their abilities to engage undead creatures and those who manipulate the necromancy that creates them.

## Order Features

### Rite of the Dawn (3rd Level)

You learn the **Rite of the Dawn** as part of your Crimson Rite feature. When you activate the Rite of the Dawn, the extra damage dealt by your rite is radiant damage.

**Benefits while Rite of the Dawn is active:**
- Your weapon sheds bright light out to a radius of 20 feet
- You have resistance to necrotic damage
- When you hit an undead creature, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite

**Example:** At 5th level with a 1d6 hemocraft die, hitting an undead creature would deal 2d6 radiant damage from the rite instead of 1d6.

### Curse Specialist (3rd Level)

You learn to master blood curses beyond the capabilities of other blood hunters.

**Benefits:**
- Gain an additional use of your Blood Maledict feature
- Your blood curses can target any creature, whether it has blood or not (without needing to amplify)

**Impact:** This effectively gives you:
- 2 uses at levels 3-5 (instead of 1)
- 3 uses at levels 6-12 (instead of 2)
- 4 uses at levels 13-16 (instead of 3)
- 5 uses at levels 17+ (instead of 4)

### Aether Walk (7th Level)

At the start of your turn (if you aren't incapacitated), you can magically step into the veil between the planes.

**Duration:** A number of rounds equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1 round)

**Effects:**
- Move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain
- See and affect creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane
- Take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object
- If the feature ends while inside an object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you moved

**Uses:** 1/short rest (2/short rest at 15th level)

**Tactical Applications:**
- Move through walls to reach enemies or escape
- Chase ethereal undead (ghosts, wraiths, etc.)
- Avoid opportunity attacks by moving through enemies
- Scout ahead through solid objects

### Brand of Sundering (11th Level)

Your Brand of Castigation exposes a fragment of your foe's essence, leaving them vulnerable to your Crimson Rite feature.

**Benefits:**
- Whenever you hit a branded creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite
- If a branded creature has the Incorporeal Movement trait (or similar), it can't move through creatures or objects while branded

**Example:** At 11th level with a 1d8 hemocraft die and Rite of the Dawn active:
- Normal hit: 1d8 radiant damage from rite
- Hit on branded creature: 2d8 radiant damage from rite
- Hit on branded undead with Rite of Dawn: 3d8 radiant damage from rite

---

### Blood Curse of the Exorcist (15th Level)

You gain the **Blood Curse of the Exorcist** for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn't count against your number of blood curses known.

**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Target:** One creature that is charmed, frightened, or possessed

**Effect:** The target creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed.

**Amplify:** A creature that charmed, frightened, or possessed the target takes 3d6 psychic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

**Uses:**
- Remove possession from allies
- Free charmed party members
- End fear effects
- Punish mind controllers when amplified

---

### Rite Revival (18th Level)

You learn to protect your fading life by reabsorbing the energy you feed to your weapons.

**Trigger:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but don't die outright

**Effect:** You can choose to have all your active crimson rites end and drop to 1 hit point instead.

**Limitations:**
- You must have one or more crimson rites active
- Doesn't work if you die outright (massive damage)
- Can only be used once per short rest (effectively, as you need active rites)

**Tactical Note:** This is essentially a free "death save" that works once per encounter, as long as you have a rite active.
