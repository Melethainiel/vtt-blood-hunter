# Order of the Mutant

**Source:** [DND Beyond - Blood Hunter Orders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#BloodHunterOrder-1610847)

The process of undertaking the Hunter's Bane ritual is a painful, scarring, and sometimes fatal experience. Those who survive are irrevocably changed — and not always for the better. Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters honed the way in which hemocraft alters the body, using corrupted alchemy and toxic elixirs to alter their blood even further. Over time, they have modified their capabilities in battle, becoming something beyond what they once were. Calling themselves the Order of the Mutant, these blood hunters now specialize in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their foes, altering their biology to be best prepared for any conflict.

## Order Features

### Mutagencraft (3rd Level)

You learn to master forbidden alchemical formulas — known as mutagens — that can temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities.

**Consuming Mutagens:**
- **Activation:** Bonus action
- **Duration:** Until you finish a short or long rest (unless specified otherwise)
- **Flushing:** Use an action to end all active mutagens and their side effects
- **Personal Use Only:** Your mutagens have no effect on other creatures
- **Instability:** Mutagens become inert if not used before you finish your next short or long rest

#### Mutagen Progression Table

| Blood Hunter Level | Mutagens Created | Formulas Known |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 3rd               | 1                | 4              |
| 7th               | 2                | 5              |
| 11th              | 2                | 6              |
| 15th              | 3                | 7              |
| 18th              | 3                | 8              |

**Creating Mutagens:** You concoct your mutagens when you finish a short or long rest. They lose potency if not used before your next rest.

**Learning Formulas:** When you learn a new mutagen formula, you can replace one formula you already know with a different one.

### Strange Metabolism (7th Level)

Your body begins to adapt to toxins and venoms, ignoring their corrupting effects.

**Benefits:**
- Immunity to poison damage
- Immunity to the poisoned condition
- **Adrenaline Burst (1/long rest):** As a bonus action, ignore the side effect of one mutagen affecting you for 1 minute

**Tactical Impact:** The adrenaline burst allows you to stack mutagens without penalties for critical moments (boss fights, emergencies).

### Brand of Axiom (11th Level)

Your mutagenic hemocraft lets your Brand of Castigation reveal a foe's true nature.

**Automatic Effects on Branded Creatures:**
- Any illusion or invisibility ends immediately
- Cannot benefit from invisibility or illusion effects while branded

**Shapechangers (Wisdom Save):**
- Target must save or:
  - Revert to true form
  - Be stunned until the end of your next turn
- Whenever the branded creature attempts to change form:
  - Must succeed on Wisdom save or the attempt fails
  - If it fails, it's stunned until the end of your next turn

**Affected Abilities:**

- Wild Shape (Druids)
- Change Shape action
- Shapechanger trait (lycanthropes, doppelgangers, etc.)

**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Save:** Constitution (repeatable at end of each turn)

**Effect:** Target becomes poisoned until it succeeds on the save.

**Amplify:** Target takes 4d6 necrotic damage when you inflict this curse, and takes this damage again each time it fails the Constitution save to end the curse.

**Note:** Combined with your poison immunity, you can safely engage poisonous creatures while inflicting poison on them.

---

### Exalted Mutation (18th Level)

Your body has adapted to produce mutagens naturally in a moment of need.

**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Effect:** Choose one mutagen currently affecting you. Its effects and side effects end, and you can immediately have a different mutagen you know the formula for take effect.

4. Consume before heading out (last all day)

**Before Combat:**
- Have combat mutagens active
- Consider flushing utility mutagens if caught off-guard

**After Combat:**
- Check if you need to adjust mutagens for next encounter
- Long rest to reset Adrenaline Burst and Exalted Mutation

- Long adventuring days (mutagens last all day)
- Parties that need a flexible member

**Less Optimal For:**
- Campaigns with very short adventuring days (less benefit from all-day buffs)
- Settings where alchemy doesn't fit thematically

### Multiclassing Considerations

**Good Synergies:**
- **Fighter (Battle Master):** Maneuvers + mutagens = incredible versatility

- **Ranger:** Hunter's Mark + Cruelty mutagen synergy

**Avoid:**
- Classes that need consistent high mental stats (Wizards, Clerics) due to mutagen side effects
