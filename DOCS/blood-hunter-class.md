# Blood Hunter Class

**Source:** [DND Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter)

Blood hunters are clever warriors driven by an unending determination to destroy evils old and new. Armed with rites of secretive blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for their cause, they protect the realms from the shadows — even as they remain ever vigilant against being drawn to the darkness that consumes the monsters they hunt.

## Multiclassing Requirements

- **Prerequisites:** Intelligence 13+ AND (Strength 13+ OR Dexterity 13+)
- **Special (Order of the Profane Soul):** Add 1/3 of blood hunter levels (rounded down) to warlock level for spell slots

## Variant Rule

**Variant Hemocraft Ability Score:** With DM permission, you can use Wisdom instead of Intelligence for all blood hunter features.
