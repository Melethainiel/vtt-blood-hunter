# Crimson Rites

Crimson Rites are elemental infusions that blood hunters can apply to their weapons through hemocraft magic.

## How Crimson Rites Work

**Activation:**
- Bonus action to activate on one weapon you're holding
- Take necrotic damage equal to one hemocraft die (cannot be reduced)
- Lasts until you finish a short or long rest

**Effects:**
- Attacks with the weapon become magical
- Deal extra damage equal to your hemocraft die of the rite's damage type
- Only one rite can be active on a weapon at a time
- Other creatures cannot benefit from your rite

**Learning Rites:**
- Learn 1 rite at 2nd level
- Learn 1 additional rite at 7th level
- Learn 1 additional rite at 14th level

## Rite Selection Strategy

### Early Game (Levels 2-6)
Choose based on common enemy resistances in your campaign:
- **Rite of the Flame:** Good general choice, many enemies vulnerable to fire
- **Rite of the Frozen:** Useful against fire-based enemies
- **Rite of the Storm:** Rare resistance type, good general choice

### Mid Game (Level 7-13)
Add versatility with a second rite to cover different enemy types.

### Late Game (Level 14+)
Advanced rites offer more exotic damage types:
- **Necrotic:** Bypasses many resistances
- **Psychic:** One of the least resisted damage types
- **Thunder:** Useful for crowd control scenarios

## Hemocraft Die Progression

- **Levels 1-4:** 1d4
- **Levels 5-10:** 1d6
- **Levels 11-16:** 1d8
