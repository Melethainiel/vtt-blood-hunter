# Blood Curses

Blood curses are hemocraft abilities that allow blood hunters to curse and manipulate creatures using their own vital essence.

## Blood Curse Mechanics

### Basic Rules
- Learn 1 blood curse at 1st level
- Learn additional curses at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level (total: 5 curses at 18th+)
- When learning a new curse, you can replace one you already know
- Choose which curse to invoke each time you use Blood Maledict

### Uses Per Rest
- **1st-5th level:** 1 use per short/long rest
- **6th-12th level:** 2 uses per short/long rest
- **13th-16th level:** 3 uses per short/long rest
- **17th-20th level:** 4 uses per short/long rest

### Amplifying Curses
Before a curse affects the target, you can choose to amplify it:
- Take necrotic damage equal to one hemocraft die (cannot be reduced)
- The curse gains an additional effect (described in each curse)
- Amplified curses affect creatures without blood (otherwise immune)

## Available Blood Curses

### General Blood Curses

#### Blood Curse of the Anxious

**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Duration:** Until the end of your next turn

You harry the body or mind of a creature within 30 feet of you, making them susceptible to forceful influence. Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against the cursed creature have advantage.

**Amplify:** The next Wisdom saving throw the cursed creature makes before this curse ends has disadvantage.

#### Blood Curse of Binding

**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Target:** Large or smaller creature  
**Save:** Strength

You attempt to bind a creature you can see. On a failed save, the cursed creature's speed is reduced to 0 and it can't use reactions until the end of your next turn.

**Amplify:** This curse lasts for 1 minute and can affect any creature regardless of size. The cursed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.

---

#### Blood Curse of Bloated Agony

**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Duration:** Until the end of your next turn

You curse a creature, causing its body to swell. For the duration, the creature has disadvantage on Strength checks and Dexterity checks, and takes 1d8 necrotic damage if it makes more than one attack during its turn.

**Amplify:** This curse lasts for 1 minute. The cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.

#### Blood Curse of Exposure

**Activation:** Reaction (when a creature takes damage from an attack or spell)  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Duration:** Until the end of the target's next turn

When a creature you can see takes damage from an attack or spell, you temporarily weaken its resilience. The target loses resistance to all the damage types dealt by the triggering attack or spell (including for that triggering effect).

**Amplify:** The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, but has resistance to those damage types until the end of its next turn.

---

#### Blood Curse of the Eyeless

**Activation:** Reaction (when a creature makes an attack)  
**Range:** 30 feet

When a creature you can see makes an attack, you roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature's attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature's roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack hits or misses. The creature is immune to this curse if it is immune to the blinded condition.

**Amplify:** You apply this curse to all the creature's attack rolls until the end of the creature's turn. You roll separately for each affected attack.

---

#### Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet

**Activation:** Reaction (when a creature drops to 0 hit points)  
**Range:** 30 feet

When a creature you can see drops to 0 hit points, you instill that creature with a final act of aggression. The creature immediately makes one weapon attack against a target of your choice within its range.

**Amplify:** You can first cause the cursed creature to move up to half its speed, and you grant a bonus to its attack roll equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of +1).

---

#### Blood Curse of the Marked

**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Duration:** Until the end of your turn

You mark a creature that you can see. Until the end of your turn, whenever you hit the cursed creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite.

**Amplify:** The next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn has advantage.

---

#### Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind

**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Target:** Creature concentrating on a spell or feature  
**Duration:** Until the end of your next turn

You curse a creature that is concentrating on a spell or using a feature that requires concentration. That creature has disadvantage on the next Constitution saving throw it makes to maintain concentration before the end of your next turn.

**Amplify:** The cursed creature has disadvantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration until the end of your next turn.

### Order-Specific Blood Curses

These curses require specific Blood Hunter Orders and high levels.

**Prerequisite:** 15th level, Order of the Mutant  
**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Save:** Constitution (repeatable at end of each turn)

You cause a creature to become poisoned. The cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.

**Range:** 30 feet

You choose one creature you can see that is charmed or frightened, or which is under a possession effect. The target creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed.

**Prerequisite:** 18th level, Order of the Lycan  
**Activation:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Save:** Wisdom  
**Duration:** Until the end of your next turn

You unleash a bloodcurdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. If a creature fails its saving throw by 5 or more, it is stunned while frightened in this way. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours.

You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the howl.

**Amplify:** The range of this curse increases to 60 feet.

**Activation:** Reaction (when a creature is reduced to 0 hit points)

**Target:** Non-construct, non-undead creature  
**Duration:** Until the end of your next turn

When a creature that isn't a construct or undead is reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet of you, you offer their life energy to your patron in exchange for power. You make attacks with advantage and you have resistance to all damage.

### Best Curses for Each Tier

**Early Game (Levels 1-5)**
1. **Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet** - Extra damage/attacks
2. **Blood Curse of Binding** - Reliable control
3. **Blood Curse of the Eyeless** - Defensive reaction

**Mid Game (Levels 6-14)**
1. **Blood Curse of Exposure** - Counter resistant enemies
2. **Blood Curse of the Marked** - Boost damage output
3. **Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind** - Break concentrations

**Late Game (Levels 15+)**
1. Order-specific curses become available
2. **Blood Curse of Exposure** (amplified) - Break immunities
3. Situational curses for specific encounters

### Amplification Decision
Weigh the cost (hemocraft die of necrotic damage) against:
- Your current hit points
- The importance of the curse succeeding
- Whether the target lacks blood (requires amplification)
- The power of the amplified effect
- Boss fights vs. regular encounters

### Resource Management
- Blood Maledict has limited uses per rest (1-4 depending on level)
- Track your uses carefully in long adventuring days
- Save amplifications for critical moments
- Crimson Rite activation also costs hit points—manage your health pool
- Consider short rests to recover both HP and Blood Maledict uses

### Timing Considerations

**Bonus Action Curses** (compete with Crimson Rite activation)
- Anxious, Binding, Bloated Agony, Marked, Muddled Mind, Corrosion, Exorcist

**Reaction Curses** (best action economy)
- Exposure, Eyeless, Fallen Puppet, Soul Eater

**Action Curses** (significant cost)
- Howl (Order of Lycan only)
