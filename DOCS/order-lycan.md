# Order of the Lycan

**Source:** [DND Beyond - Blood Hunter Orders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#BloodHunterOrder-1610847)

The ancient curse of lycanthropy is feared by nearly all peoples and cultures, passed through blood and seeding a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud group of blood hunters who undergo "the Taming" — the ceremonial infliction of lycanthropy by a senior member of the order, for those who do not already carry the curse before seeking this path. These hunters then use the magic of their blood to harness the power of the monster they harbor, without losing themselves to it. Using intense will and secret blood magic rituals, members of the Order of the Lycan learn to control and unleash their hybrid forms for short periods of time.

**Important Note:** This feature replaces the rules for lycanthropy in the Monster Manual. You are not subject to the standard lycanthropy curse mechanics.

### Hybrid Transformation (3rd Level)

You learn to control the lycanthropic curse that courses through your veins.

**Activation:** Bonus action  
**Duration:** Up to 1 hour  
**Reversion:** Bonus action, or automatically if you fall unconscious or die  
**Uses:** 1/short rest (2/short rest at 11th, unlimited at 18th)

**Capabilities While Transformed:**
- Can speak, use equipment, and wear armor
- Retain all class features and abilities
- Gain all benefits listed below

#### Feral Might
- Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws
- Bonus to melee damage rolls:
  - **+1** at 3rd level
  - **+2** at 11th level
  - **+3** at 18th level

#### Resilient Hide
- Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons
- **+1 bonus to AC** while not wearing heavy armor

#### Predatory Strikes
- Apply Crimson Rite to your unarmed strikes (treating them as one weapon)
- Use Dexterity instead of Strength for unarmed strike attacks and damage
- Unarmed strikes deal:
  - **1d6** bludgeoning or slashing damage (your choice) at 3rd level
  - **1d8** bludgeoning or slashing damage at 11th level
- When you use the Attack action to make an unarmed strike, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action

**Example:** At 5th level with Extra Attack and a 1d6 hemocraft die using Rite of the Flame:
- Action: Two unarmed strikes (1d6 + Dex + 1d6 fire + 1 Feral Might each)
- Bonus Action: One unarmed strike (1d6 + Dex + 1d6 fire + 1 Feral Might)
- **Total: 3 attacks per round**

#### Bloodlust (The Drawback)
If you start your turn with fewer hit points than half your hit point maximum, you must succeed on a **DC 8 Wisdom saving throw** or lose control:
- Must move directly toward the nearest creature
- Must use the Attack action against that creature
- You choose whether to use Extra Attack
- If multiple creatures are equally near, roll randomly for target
- Automatically fail this save if concentrating on a spell or under effects that prevent concentration (like Barbarian Rage)

**Once the attack is resolved, you regain control.**

### Advanced Transformation (11th Level)

- **Blood Curses:** Marked, Fallen Puppet, Exposure, Binding, Howl (18th)

### Managing Bloodlust

**Tips to Maintain Control:**
1. Keep your HP above 50% when possible
2. Invest in Wisdom for better saves (DC 8 is usually manageable)
3. At 15th level, you have advantage on the save
4. Position yourself near enemies you WANT to attack
5. Use regeneration to stay above the threshold

**When Bloodlust Triggers:**
- Try to position near priority targets before getting bloodied
- Accept that 1-2 rounds of lost control isn't catastrophic
- Your attacks are still effective even when frenzied
- Allies can heal you above 50% to end the effect

### Synergies
- **Hybrid Transformation + Crimson Rite:** 3 attacks with rite damage
- **Lycan Regeneration + Resilient Hide:** Stay in the fight longer
- **Brand of Castigation + Brand of the Voracious:** Guaranteed advantage on a key target
- **Blood Curse of the Marked + 3 Attacks:** Massive burst damage
- **Blood Curse of the Howl + Hybrid Form:** AOE fear while transformed

### Action Economy

**Typical Combat Round (Transformed):**
- **Bonus Action:** Unarmed strike (or Crimson Rite activation turn 1)
- **Action:** Attack action (2 unarmed strikes with Extra Attack at 5th+)
- **Reaction:** Blood Curse (if available)

**First Round Setup:**
- **Option A:** Transform (bonus) → Attack (action)
- **Option B:** Crimson Rite (bonus) → Attack (action), Transform next round
- **Option C (Prepared):** Transform before combat → Rite (bonus) → Attack (action)

### Campaign Fit

**Best For:**
- High-combat campaigns
- Frontline party compositions
- Gritty, savage settings
- Campaigns where lycanthropy themes fit

**Less Optimal For:**
- Social-heavy campaigns (Bloodlust can be problematic)
- Campaigns requiring subtlety
- Settings where lycanthropes are kill-on-sight

### Multiclassing Considerations

**Good Synergies:**
- **Barbarian (2-3 levels):** Rage + Resilient Hide = incredible tankiness (but auto-fail Bloodlust)
- **Fighter (3 levels):** Battle Master maneuvers or Champion crit range
- **Monk:** Redundant with unarmed strikes; not recommended

**Note:** Rage prevents you from controlling Bloodlust, but the damage output and durability can be worth it in some builds.
